# Deep-Unfolded-D-ADMM

# Introduction

This repository implement the proposed the proposal D-ADMM algorithm and the unfolded D-ADMM

# Python code
## Description
The code includes one file named 'main.py' in which the DNN model is being defined and the training procedure is being executed as well.

## Execution
To execute the code you can use any Python IDE, we used PyCharm.

You need to install the following Python libraries:
* SciPy
* NumPy
* PyTorch
* Matplotlib
* NetworknX

# Data
## Distributed LASSO Problem
The link to the data for the distributed LASSO problem: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fbPHrS1ICw4bvawPwJJNCiqBUjdLrDx2?usp=sharing

The folder contains four directories for different SNR values {-2, 0, 2, 4}, in each directory there are data.npy and labels.npy files. 

When you load the data set allow_pockle=True.

## Distributed Linear Regression Problem
For the distributed linear regression problem I used MNIST dataset.

## Federated Learning Problem
For the federated learning problem I used MNIST dataset.
